you take over a center by touching it


a small neural network to govern large scale strategy like when to go aggressive/defensive, based on questions like enemy numbers and distributions
so the system creates a matrix that has number of players near our bases in one dimension, ratio of our bases to their bases, ratio of our teammates vs their team mates
the value at each matrix cell indicating defense vs offense. The idea being that optimal strategy may matter on the situation but also on the history



use genetic algorithm to govern microscale like at what range to fire at enemy
